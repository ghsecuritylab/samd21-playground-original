/**
 * \mainpage SD/MMC Card with FatFs Example
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * This example shows how to implement the SD/MMC stack with the FatFS.
 * It will mount the file system and write a file in the card.
 *
 * The example outputs the information through the standard output (stdio).
 * To know the output used on the board, look in the conf_example.h file
 * and connect a terminal to the correct port.
 *
 * While using Xplained Pro evaluation kits, please attach I/O1 Xplained Pro
 * extension board to EXT1.
 *
 * Support and FAQ: visit <a href="http://www.atmel.com/design-support/">Atmel Support</a>
